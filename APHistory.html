    <h1>AP World History:</h1>

    <p>This is one of those classes where they push so much information at one time that it's hard to keep
    up with the important events that happened in every time period. For the exam, you do need to know about most
  of the things that happened in each time period, but some units are more important than others especially
units 3, 4, and 5 (Land-Based Empires, Transoceanic Interconnections, and Revolutions). This exam consists of 55 multiple
choice questions, a short-answer question, a DBQ, and a long essay question. In order to make sure you remember all the content,
here are some resources you can use.</p>

      <p class="eng">This AP World History book will help you score a perfect 5 on the exam as it <br>offers a study guide that will help you be a little more prepared for <br>the exam.
        This book also provides content similar to what you're learning <br>in class and emphasizes on the important info needed
        for the exam. This AP History <br>book provides testing strategies for pacing yourself and guessing logically.
        It <br>also gives access to online study plans, list of key terms and concepts, helpful pre-college <br>information, and more.
      I heavily recommend getting some time of review book</p>
